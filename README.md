# Java-Project-Part-1
Showcasing Java skills in a project implementing JavaFX. This project is part of a series of 4 projects showcasing my use of Java, all of which are connected and build off of each other. 

This part of my JavaFX project worked towards creating a program which would display a specific pattern of shapes on the screen once the program was run. The pattern of shapes is shown in the writeup for reference. Additionally, the writeup consists of the details of all the classes in the program - how they are related to each other and what methods they have. The writeup also provides the explanation of how the pattern was made using the aforementioned classes and instances of them.
